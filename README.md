Hi! I created this program to calculate the minimum amount of effort to try on a final given my 4 quarter grades.
I also wanted to incorperate some Object Oriented Programming I just learned because it would help with iterating over all of the test users. 
And lastly I wanted to do this prodject using an excel file because it would help me with caalculating all of the scenerios for next years grades.

DIRECTIONS:

1. Make sure you go to middle or highschool in Howard County. This program's math is for the HCPSS 8020 Grading Policy and nothing else.

2. Open up the 'Gradebook.xlsx' File and enter your name, and quarter grades, and then the final overall grade you want. You can do multiple students as this is the basis of why I am using excel files. Leave the last two columns blank because that is what the program will calculate.

3. Then make sure to CLOSE AND SAVE your excel file. If it is still open you will get a permission error.

4. Make sure to keep the file in the folder and do not rename it.

5. Then open the file in VSCode and hit play or use CMD to run the python file. The program will print the results and will write over the excel file to fill in the two last columns.

Thank you for reading
